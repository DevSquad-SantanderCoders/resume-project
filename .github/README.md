# <h1 align='center'>RESUME PROJECT </h1>

## Description 📚

This is the final project of the Angular Framework I module of the Santander Coders program. The project consists of a web application that displays the interface of a resume containing all the information of a specific candidate, including the ability to upload a photo stored on the user's machine. Additionally, there is the possibility to get in touch through a form that validates the entered data. We used HTML, SCSS, Bootstrap, Typescript, and Angular to create the interface and interactivity of the application. The concept of componentization, Input and Output, custom directive, custom pipe, and validated form were used. Project versioning was done using Git and Github, allowing each group member to contribute and track changes.
